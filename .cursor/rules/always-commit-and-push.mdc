# Always Commit and Push After Changes

**This rule is mandatory. There are no exceptions.**

Whenever you have made (or the user has made) any changes to files in the workspace in the current conversation turn:

1. **You MUST** run these commands after completing all changes for the prompt and **before** reporting back to the user:
   - `git add -A`
   - `git commit -m "<clear, descriptive message>"`
   - `git push origin <current-branch>` (typically `main`)

2. **Do not** say that changes have been "committed and pushed" unless you have actually run `git push` and seen a successful push in the command output.

3. **Do not** skip this step because of wording, time, or "summary" responses. If you edited or created any file, commit and push in the same turn.

4. If push fails (e.g. auth, network), report the error and tell the user what they need to do; do not leave the repo with uncommitted or unpushed changes without explaining.

5. Treat this as non-negotiable process: no compromise, no "I'll do it next time." Do it every time.
